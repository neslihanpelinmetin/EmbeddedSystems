# Embedded Systems

This repository contains materials, assignments, and interactive projects related to **CMPE 453: Embedded Systems**, offered in the Fall 2023 semester at TED University.

## ðŸ“š Course Description

This course focuses on embedded system architectures and programming, covering both AVR and ARM-based microcontrollers. Topics include:

- AVR (ATmega328P) and ARM (LPC2148) architectures
- Embedded C programming
- Serial Communication (USART, SPI, I2C)
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
- Timers, PWM
- Interrupt handling
- GPIO configuration
  
## ðŸ“˜ Reading Material

- **Required**:
  - *Make: AVR Programming* by Elliot Williams (3rd Edition)
  - LPC2148 Datasheet
- **Recommended**:
  - *The AVR Microcontroller and Embedded Systems* by Mazidi et al.
  - *ARM System Developerâ€™s Guide* by Sloss et al.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Identify components of embedded systems
2. Understand microcontroller architectures
3. Write Embedded C programs
4. Use ports and I/O protocols
5. Handle serial communication and interrupts
